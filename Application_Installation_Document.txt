2) Open the mysql-work-bench, and run the sql files given on the GitHub location, https://github.com/wilyfoxtech/OSIPrototype to create database and test date. Files are:
   a) https://github.com/wilyfoxtech/OSIPrototype/tree/master/DB/Database_creation.sql
   b) https://github.com/wilyfoxtech/OSIPrototype/tree/master/DB/Data_creation.sql
3) Please refresh schema list and you would see "fostercare" database being created and ready to use.
 
Php installtion
---------------------
1) Download the zip file from download location given above and un-zip into drive of your choice lets say, "C:\php". The contents have to be directly under this location and not as a subdirectory.
2) Goto location "c:\php\" and create a copy of file "php.ini-production" and name it "php.ini".
3) Open the file "php.ini", enable mysql for php by un-commenting the lines for:
   a) extension=php_mysql.dll
   b) extension=php_mysqli.dll
   c) extension=php_openssl.dll
   d) extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll
   
   You could enable these extensions by removing prefixed ";" and saving the file.

Install Apache HTTP server

1) Download the  apache server as a zip file from above location.
2) Un-zip the contentained folder "Apache24" to "c:\Apache24".
3) Open file "c:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf", locate string "#LoadModule xml2enc_module modules/mod_xml2enc.so", and immediately after, insert below lines, to enable php on apache server, and save it.

LoadModule php5_module "c:/php/php5apache2_4.dll"
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
# configure the path to php.ini
PHPIniDir "C:/php"

5) Copy the contents of GitHub website, "https://github.com/wilyfoxtech/OSIPrototype", into location "C:\Apache24\htdocs\OSIPrototype".
6) Stop IIS if it is running as it would clash with Apache server.
7) Navigate to URL "http://localhost/OSIPrototype/login.php" and you would be displayed with a webpage similar to our public URL, http://adpq-poc.azurewebsites.net/.
