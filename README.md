# OSIPrototype
An open source technology based web app prototype to showcase child welfare services/case management system.

#Wily Fox’s OSI ADPQ Prototype 
Wily Fox Technologies’ prototype application is a demonstration of our open agile software development approach.  This working prototype allows parents of foster kids to establish and manage a profile that they set up, view children’s residential facilities within their zip code, and securely communicate with a case worker using the application.  The application leverages an open data set through California Health & Human Services API, which includes data for foster family agency locations.  

#Our Approach
We started our effort by establishing the team and assigning roles, which follow:
Product Manager – Phil Smith 
Technical Architect – Phil Smith
Interaction Designer/User Researcher – Ram Dongre
Writer – Phil Smith
Business Analyst – Sri Latha 
Front End Web Developer – Ram Dongre
Backend Web Developer – Kirk Noe
DevOps Engineer – Ram Dongre
Usability Tester – Carole McCormick 
Understand What People Need
Once the roles were established we put our efforts to addressing what the prototype needed to achieve to meet the business and human needs of the effort.  We started with the broad goals of what the application needed to meet, and then created user stories to address the main categories off the application: establishing a profile, viewing facilities within a zip code, and secure case worker communication.  During the user stories the team met as a whole to make sure we shared a single and common vision, and to establish a clear direction.  

This also helped the team approach the problem with a human centric design.  We acted as a focus group that was comprised of the implementation project team and some participating in the role of stakeholders.  Together we created and refined the user stories, and created priorities to populate our product and sprint backlog.  

The user stories help to make sure there is a clear understanding of the user’s expectations, that the users are then involved in the throughout the iterative process.  The design and implementation can then be refined through user-centered evaluation and testing, which helps to address the entire user experience.  Also, by involving technical members in the team, it helps with level set efforts based on multidisciplinary skills.
